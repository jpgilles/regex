	Purpose: 	{Regex to parse converter}
	History:	{Started: 2017-05-09
				v.0.1: 2017-05-12 -- first working version with: 
					start `^^` and end `$` anchors, 
					non-capturing groups (one level) with alterns, 
					quantifiers (possessive), 
					some character-classes.
				v.0.2: 2017-05-15 -- 
					hack to avoid recursive calls, got nested groups,
					added some wordclasses
				v.0.3: 2017-05-16 --
					made re-ctx reactive, 
					implemented singleline and multiline refinements,
					wordboundaries,
					added some special characters
				2017-05-17 --
					added negative and positive on-spot charclasses, without subtraction
				v.0.4: 2017-05-18 --
					noncapturing groups (just correct syntax)
					added capturing groups with backreferences to captured strings (\1, \2...)
				2017-05-19 -- restructured the output: by default `regex` now just takes `re` and returns the spec block. 
					With refinement `/string str` string to be parsed by regex may be provided. In this 
					case spec block is created and provided string parsed with this spec. 
					With refinement `/withspec` spec block is also printed out. 
					`/case` refinement still there, as well as 
					`/singleline` and `/multiline`.
					Also added primitive `/debug` refinement, which shows collected quantifiers and sequences on each step, 
					and preliminary `/try flavor` refinement, which will be used to try out major flavors of `re`s.
				2017-05-20 -- changed `/string str` refinement into `/parse str` 
					and `/withspec` refinement into `spec`
				2017-05-22 -- corrected groups nesting and backreferences, compacted code
				v.0.5: 2017-05-23 --
					added soubroutines with several syntactic flavors (PCRE, Perl, Ruby):
					a) named groups declaration
						(?P<name>regex), (?'name'regex), (?<name>regex)
					b) referring subroutines
						absolute reference
						(?1), \g'1', \g<1> - number referring to the capturing group (see example with ip-v4)
						relative reference
						(?+1), (?-2), \g'+3', \g<-4>
						named reference
						(?&name), (?P>name), \g'name', \g<name>
					added backreferences with several syntactic flavors:
					a) numbered backreferences
						\1, \2, ...
					b) named backreferences to captured strings
						(?P=name), \k'name', \k<name>, \k{name} 
					added some examples
				2017-05-23 -- made regex case-sensitive by default, 
					changed `/case` refinement into `/icase` to turn it case-insensitive
					added inline comments syntax - (?# Comment )
				2017-05-24 -- added `/freespace` refinement - see corresponding example
				2017-05-25 -- added short refinements `/i`, `/s`, `/m` and `/x`, with same meaning as 
					`/icase`, `/singleline`, `/multiline` and `/freespace` correspondingly.
					Also added `/modes options` refinement, where shortcoded switches can be set in one string.
					Made freespace more permissive and made an enhanced example for it.
				v.0.6:	2017-05-27 -- 
					normalized freespace handling
					added capturing of overall match into `br_0` (changed later into `&0`)
					added global mode refinements `/global` and `/g`
					and a map `br_`, which holds captured strings on numbered or named keys:
						if in global mode -- in blocks, otherwise in strings (see examples)
				2017-05-28 -- added refinements `/simplex` with short alias `/n` to turn on non-capturing mode, 
					where only named groups are captured (and numbered)
				2017-05-29 -- changed `br_` into tcl-like `&` and made it changeable. It can be changed
					as eg. `re-ctx/symbol: 'Â¤`. See examples. Earlier examples presume symbol `br_`.
				v.0.7:	2017-05-30 --
					added first bit of `/replace replacement` refinement. `replacement` is string (so far), 
					which may include backreferences to captured strings in the same form as in matching, 
					or as `\'1'` or `\'name'`. `name` may be assigned a value in matching, but also outside 
					of the `regex`. The overall match is replaced by evaluated replacement. 
					Also in `global` mode. Examples.
			}
	TBD: 	{atomic groups, "soft" quantifiers, character-class subtraction, switches, substitution, look-around etc
				inline created words are leaking into global environment}

	Purpose: 	{Regex to parse converter}
	Licence: "MIT"
	History:	{Started: 2017-05-09
				v.0.1: 2017-05-12 -- first working version with: 
					start `^^` and end `$` anchors, 
					non-capturing groups (one level) with alterns, 
					quantifiers (possessive), 
					some character-classes.
				v.0.2: 2017-05-15 -- 
					hack to avoid recursive calls, got nested groups,
					added some wordclasses
				v.0.3: 2017-05-16 --
					made re-ctx reactive, 
					implemented singleline and multiline refinements,
					wordboundaries,
					added some special characters
				2017-05-17 --
					added negative and positive on-spot charclasses, without subtraction
				v.0.4: 2017-05-18 --
					noncapturing groups (just correct syntax)
					added capturing groups with backreferences to captured strings (\1, \2...)
				2017-05-19 -- restructured the output: by default `regex` now just takes `re` and returns the spec block. 
					With refinement `/string str` string to be parsed by regex may be provided. In this 
					case spec block is created and provided string parsed with this spec. 
					With refinement `/withspec` spec block is also printed out. 
					`/case` refinement still there, as well as 
					`/singleline` and `/multiline`.
					Also added primitive `/debug` refinement, which shows collected quantifiers and sequences on each step, 
					and preliminary `/try flavor` refinement, which will be used to try out major flavors of `re`s.
				2017-05-20 -- changed `/string str` refinement into `/parse str` 
					and `/withspec` refinement into `spec`
				2017-05-22 -- corrected groups nesting and backreferences, compacted code
				v.0.5: 2017-05-23 --
					added soubroutines with several syntactic flavors (PCRE, Perl, Ruby):
					a) named groups declaration
						(?P<name>regex), (?'name'regex), (?<name>regex)
					b) referring subroutines
						absolute reference
						(?1), \g'1', \g<1> - number referring to the capturing group (see example with ip-v4)
						relative reference
						(?+1), (?-2), \g'+3', \g<-4>
						named reference
						(?&name), (?P>name), \g'name', \g<name>
					added backreferences with several syntactic flavors:
					a) numbered backreferences
						\1, \2, ...
					b) named backreferences to captured strings
						(?P=name), \k'name', \k<name>, \k{name} 
					added some examples
				2017-05-23 -- made regex case-sensitive by default, 
					changed `/case` refinement into `/icase` to turn it case-insensitive
					added inline comments syntax - (?# Comment )
				2017-05-24 -- added `/freespace` refinement - see corresponding example
				2017-05-25 -- added short refinements `/i`, `/s`, `/m` and `/x`, with same meaning as 
					`/icase`, `/singleline`, `/multiline` and `/freespace` correspondingly.
					Also added `/modes options` refinement, where shortcoded switches can be set in one string.
					Made freespace more permissive and made an enhanced example for it.
				v.0.6:	2017-05-27 -- 
					normalized freespace handling
					added capturing of overall match into `br_0` (changed later into `&0`)
					added global mode refinements `/global` and `/g`
					and a map `br_`, which holds captured strings on numbered or named keys:
						if in global mode -- in blocks, otherwise in strings (see examples)
				2017-05-28 -- added refinements `/simplex` with short alias `/n` to turn on non-capturing mode, 
					where only named groups are captured (and numbered)
				2017-05-29 -- changed `br_` into tcl-like `&` and made it changeable. It can be changed
					as eg. `re-ctx/symbol: 'Â¤`. See examples. Earlier examples presume symbol `br_`.
				v.0.7:	2017-05-30 --
					added first bit of `/replace replacement` refinement. `replacement` is string (so far), 
					which may include backreferences to captured strings in the same form as in matching, 
					or as `\'1'` or `\'name'`. `name` may be assigned a value in matching, but also outside 
					of the `regex`. The overall match is replaced by evaluated replacement. 
					Also in `global` mode. Examples.
				2017-05-31 -- corrected some mistakes. Reorganised replacement code. 
					Added block! as replacement. In case of global parsing replaces matches in the block order,
					eg. `a: "first" regex/parse/g/replace "\w+" x: "1 second 3" [a "\0" "third"] head x` would yield
					`"first second third"`. Only as many matches will be changed as there are elements in the block, 
					superfluous elements in the block will be disregarded. 
					Some stylistic change of code in `build` function.
				2017-06-01 -- Allowed any-string! as `/parse string` argument, 
					so that emails, urls, tags and filenames could be parsed directly.
					corrected treatment of quantified parentheses, eg. (\w)* . Previously the pattern was quantified, 
						so it captured strings of different letters (if any), 
						now the captured letter is quantified, so it captures strings of same letter.
				2017-06-03 -- Added basic support for lookaround, both negative and positive lookahead and lookbehind.
				2017-06-08 -- Added refinement `/possessive`, short `/+`, which switches on possessive mode, so that 
					soft quantifiers lose their meaning.
					Made symbols that leak into global environment cleanable. They are unset by calling `re-ctx/clean`,
						on every calling of `regex` and also on every loading of %regex.red
				2017-06-13 -- Got soft quantifiers to work correctly while not in/on groups or charsets.
				2017-06-17 -- Charclasses can now include `shortclasses`, e.g. `\d` or `\w`, which means that these 
						charclasses are connected through `union`. Also `[:alpha:]` kind of classes may be included.
					* subtraction with syntax `[class1-[class2]]`, which is interpreted as `exclude class1 class2`;
					* intersection with syntax `[class1&&[class2]]`, interpreted as `intersect class1 class2`;
					* negated charclasses may give unexpected results with intersect due to the `red` mechanism
						of allocating bits to bitset. E.g "[\d&&[^^1234]]" (intersect charset [#"0" - #"9"] complement charset "1234")
						should result in "056789", but results actually in "0567". To avoid this, use exclusion instead: 
						"[\d-[1234]]" (exclude charset [#"0" - #"9"] charset "1234"). TBD: do this automatically
					* soft quantifiers now work also on charclasses (but not in and on groups).
				2017-06-18 -- Corrected negative lookbehind behavior. It is still not correct if there are more than one lookaround.
				2017-06-22 -- Added conditionals with syntax `(?(if)then|else)`. `if` may be a number referencing captured group 
					e.g "(pretty )?(?(1)girls|boys)", which matches "pretty girls" and "boys",	or it may be lookaround 
					(currently only lookahead), e.g. "b(?(?=i)inary|unny)", which matches "binary" and "bunny". 
					`then` and `else` may be any re-s (currently excluding soft quantifiers).

	TBD: 	{"soft" quantifiers in/on groups/lookarounds, substitution with maps and functions, multiple look-arounds, conditionals}
